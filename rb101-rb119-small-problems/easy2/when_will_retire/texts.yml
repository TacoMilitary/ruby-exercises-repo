welcome: |
 I'm going to tell you when you're going to be retiring!
 Just give me your age and the age you'd like to retire at.

age_ask: 'How old are you now?'

retire_ask: 'What age would you like to retire?'

deduction: |
 Since it is {{year}}, you will retire in {{retire}}.
 There are {{time}} years to go!

age_error: 'You must input a real age!'

younger_retire_error: 'Your retire age must be older than your current age!'
